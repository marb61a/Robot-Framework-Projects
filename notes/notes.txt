Robot Framework
    - https://robotframework.org/
    - Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing
        - This allows for business users to test who will not know coding
    - It has a tabular syntax which uses a keyword-driven testing approach
        - There are numerous keywords in the framework
        - For most tasks (Around 90% plus) there is a keyword which avoids coding
    - The libraries are implemented in Java and Python
        - Either can be used to write custom keywords

Advantages of Robot Framework
    - It is free so there are no licensing costs
    - The syntax is fairly easy to learn
    - There is fast developement with minimum coding
    - There is detailed reporting in default reports
    - There are a lot of libraries available 
    - It has a distributed structure
    - Many different types of applications can be automated

Test libraries
    - There are a lot of libraries packed with keywords

Creating A New Project
    - In VSCode simply add folder or from the command line using the following command 
        - mkdir <folder_name>
        - Adding folders is the same method in the project
    - When adding Robot files the files must have the .robot extension
    - Writing test cases directly inside the project is not good practice
        - Instead have a separate folder for test cases
    - Robot files are divided into multiple sections
        - These can be seen in VSCode by typing ***
        - Other editors may need typing the stars and then CTRL+SPACE
    - This should bring up 4 different options in a hidden menu
        - Key Words, Settings, Variables, Test Cases
        - Settings should always be at the top
        - Keywords are normally defined in a separate file
    - The SeleniumLibrary which needs to be imported is installed with Robot 
        - ChromeDriver will need to be imported and added to the Python scripts folder
            - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
            - There is no separate 32 and 64 bit driver
        - GeckoDriver is used for Firefox
            - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
        - These drivers are the interface between the browser and test case
    - !!! There needs to be at least two spaces between a setting name and the setting value

Writing a Test Case in Robot Framework
    - Create a new file with .robot extension
    - To import SeleniumLibrary simply use -> Library  SeleniumLibrary
    - A variable is defined using the following syntax
        - ${variable_name}  value an example is as follows
        - ${Browser}  Chrome
        - The value is not a string so no inverted commas
    - TestCases can be named as anything but may be better if the name make sense
        - The values in the test case need to be indented
        - There must always be 2 spaces between variables added
    - To run the robot file use the following command
        - robot <file_name>
        - This can be ran from the project root, path to file must be correct
        - There are a number of files generated which report on how the test performed
    - Add comments by using the # symbol

Keyword Suggestions
    - If there are no suggestions for keywords (Using PyCharm)
    - The intellibot plugin needs to be installed and one with SeleniumLibrary support added
    
Element Locators
    - Using SeleniumIDE for recording and playback to find elements
        - https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/
    - There are alternatives such as Katalon Studio and the browser plugin Katalon Recorder
